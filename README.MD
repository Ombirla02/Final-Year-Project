Make a new venv with py version 3.12.3 ( usually its better to have same version to run into unexpected issues )
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all requirements after making the venv
(side note make a .env file with random key in it like SECRET_KEY='key' rn its not required to work)

Basic Flask knowledge will be required even if you are not working on backend as how it works is important on arranging the frontend.
